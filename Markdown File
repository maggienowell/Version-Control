I learned how to operate the basics of GitHub, something I have never used before. I learned how to create a new repository, add my license, and so much more. 
I am still a bit confused on the site, but I'm sure I will get better and more confident with more experience.
I picked the MIT license because it was described to be simple and permissive, which seems appropriate for this first simple assignment.
I am attempting to experiment on this file in my Experiment branch so I can compare it to main in a pull request to finish the assignment.
